        ABOUT ME
    </h2>

    <P class="grp1"> 

    Iam a graduate of Alliance Girls High School<br>I studied basic coding 
    skills in school and from youtube<br> Iam a member of the National chess Team in Kenya<br>
    I love coffee but can't take it as often as i would like because i<br>have a stomach condition.
    I love travelling but I am too lazy.<br>I like chocolate but why does it have to be so expensive<br>
    If I wouldn't have to work I would play video games for the<br> rest of my life.I like cats 
    more than dogs but i<br>can never admit it.
